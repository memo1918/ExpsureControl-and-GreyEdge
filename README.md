# Gain and illuminant estimation
This simple code inlcudes a exposure/gain estimation algorithm from Torres & Menéndez [1] and a computational color constancy algorithm grey-edge [2].

This repo does not ment to build or run but to give an understanding of how to implement them in your project.

## Acknowledgments
These implmenetations were done for my thesis protoype.

The grey-edge algorithm might not perfrom as intended.

Grey-edge algorithm is adopted from https://github.com/MinaSGorgi/Color-Constancy/tree/master
